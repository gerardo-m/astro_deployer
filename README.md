# ASTRO DEPLOYER

The goal of this scripts is to deploy an static Astro site
on another directory locally.

## Why?

Because I have a server in my local network that doesn't
have a dedicated ip address, so I can't setup an existing
CD solution.

And because I wanted to do something with bash

## THIS IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS
